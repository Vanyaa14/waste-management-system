📌 Overview

The Smart Waste Management System is an AI-powered application designed to classify waste into different categories and provide appropriate disposal suggestions. This project aims to promote proper waste segregation and environmental sustainability using Machine Learning.

---

🎯 Objectives

- Develop an intelligent system for waste classification
- Assist users in proper waste disposal
- Promote environmental awareness using AI
- Apply Machine Learning to solve real-world problems

❗ Problem Statement

Improper waste segregation leads to pollution, environmental damage, and inefficient recycling. Many people are unaware of how to correctly dispose of waste. This project solves this problem by providing an automated classification system.

---

💡 Proposed Solution

This system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste images into:

- Hazardous ☠️
- Non-Recyclable 🚫
- Organic 🌱
- Recyclable ♻️

It also provides disposal suggestions based on the predicted category.
